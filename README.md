### Notes
- Training examples with documentation:
  - pretraining.py - pretraining for models with uncertainty estimation
  - uncertainty_training.py - training for models with uncertainty estimation,
    use checkpoints produced by pretraining.py as a starting point.
  - yolov3_training.py  - standard yolov3 without any uncertainty estimation
  - look for "edit" comments
- Forward passes:
  - detect.py (processes a list of images)
  - inference_*.py scripts. They process tfrecord files and produce ECP (euro city persons) formated json files.
  - Note NMS yields up to 1000 boxes, might be slow. Change the "nms" functions if you want better performance.
  - Current NMS implementation ignores classes.
     Example code used in the paper is given as comments (only works for two classes).
  - look for "edit" comments
- tfrecords format:
  - same as for the tensorflow object detection API,
     however we also support tfrecords files where the label ids start at 0 instead of 1.
     This is controlled by setting "implicit_background_class" to True (start at 1) or False (start at 0).
  - example script to create tfrecordsfile is provided (create_tf_records_citypersons.py)
- Pretrained yolov3 weights:
  - you need to download the "darknet53.conv.74" from the original yolov3 site (pjreddie).
- Most things you can change should be marked with an "edit" comment.
